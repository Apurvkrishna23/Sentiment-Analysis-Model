📊 Workflow Overview
1️⃣ Load & Understand Data (EDA)

Inspect class imbalance

Analyze tweet length & text patterns

Generate WordCloud

Check distribution of labels

Inspect sample tweets

2️⃣ Preprocessing

Remove URLs, mentions, special characters

Lowercasing

Lemmatization

Stopword removal

Feature engineering:

Tweet length

Number of hashtags, mentions

URL flag

VADER sentiment score (optional)

3️⃣ Model Training

✔ TF–IDF Vectorizer (1–2 n-grams)
✔ Logistic Regression with class balancing
✔ Optional: LSTM deep learning model with Embeddings

4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision / Recall / F1

Confusion Matrix

ROC–AUC Curve

SHAP Explainability (optional)

5️⃣ Saving Artifacts

Save pipeline to models/tfidf_logreg_pipeline.pkl

Save tokenizer + LSTM weights (optional)

6️⃣ Deployment
✔ FastAPI Backend

Endpoints:

GET /health
POST /predict


Request:

{
  "text": "The flight was delayed but the crew was nice!"
}


Response:

{
  "prediction": "positive",
  "positive_probability": 0.8421
}

✔ Streamlit Dashboard

User enters tweet

Dashboard predicts sentiment

Displays results + probabilities

Can display charts (WordCloud, class distribution, etc.)

✔ Docker Support

API can be containerized with the provided Dockerfile

Deployable to Render / Railway / AWS / Azure
